Welcome in the formatting tool for the Remagus02 dataset in direction to CICS
We suppose you have done the querying of a database and you have separated values files (csv,tsv,xls, etc.).
Such values tables describe samples over multiples features, rows samples and features as columns or vice-versa.
We will try to format it into this representation :
- a .csv file that have succesively 3 groups of columns as features with features names as the titles of the columns
+ 1 column as the classes and titled BestResCategory
+ multiples columns, each one as a feature tityle the feature name
+ 1 column as the samples and titled Model
Necessary libraries imported.
Environnement variables initialised.

Preprocessing...
Report on the losses during the cleaning of the uncomplete samples info of the left table :
9 samples has been lost during the cleaning of the uncomplete samples info of the left table
Report on the losses during the cleaning of the uncomplete features info of the joined table :
No samples has been lost during the cleaning of the uncomplete features info of the joined table
Describing the obtained final samples-features-response frame...
The frame to analyse has  221 samples and  54675 features
Among 221 samples, 2 classes has been detected as being : Res and Sen.
The class value Res is found on 185 samples counting for 83.710 % of the samples
The class value Sen is found on 36 samples counting for 16.290 % of the samples
The final dataframe (dframe) is ready ! Lets save it in a .csv file...
File saved !
REMAGUS02 dataset formatting for CICS analysis is done!
