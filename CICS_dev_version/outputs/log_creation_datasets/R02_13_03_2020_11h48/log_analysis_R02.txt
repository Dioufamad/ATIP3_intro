DESCRIBING THE OBTAINED FINAL SAMPLES-FEATURES-RESPONSE FRAME...
The frame to analyse has  221 samples and  54675 features
Among 221 samples, 2 classes has been detected as being : Res and Sen.
The class value Res is found on 185 samples counting for 83.710 % of the samples
The class value Sen is found on 36 samples counting for 16.290 % of the samples
This is a description of the first 10 features values

DATA FILTERING...
No feature have been taken out of the final frame due to non informativeness.
In the resulting final frame 54675 features remaining describing 221 samples.
UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS
Univariate Analysis : histograms for the ditribution of a features's attributes in each class (Figure 1)
Univariate Analysis : LVplot (letter value plot) for classes behaviour in regards to a feature (Figure 2)
MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS
Multivariate Analysis : Heatmaps for correlation between features (Figure 3)
Multivariate Analysis : Equatorial coordinates to see if the values of a couple of features differ between the classes (Figure 4)
Multivariate Analysis : features ranking with Student t-test p-values (Table 1)
The feature ranking final dataframe (dframe) is ready ! Lets save it in a .csv file...
