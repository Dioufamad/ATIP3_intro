###### Welcome to the ATIP3_intro wiki!

A start on ATIP 3 and around it a bit...

Scientific questions : 

- Q1 : What are the molecular workings of the ATIP3 protein that causes those severe cases of breast cancer ?
- Q2 : What compound could be cancdidate for a treatment ?

###### Progress on Q1

Steps for Q1 : 
- 0 : make a code for each class of methods as ready to run code 
- 1 : just choose a dataset for gex and compare away! 
- 2 : a synthetic benchmark is needed. NB : the email of the synthetic dataset from Chlo√© use it for the synthetic benchmark after the code is ready 
- 3 : we need to push further on the networks and compare them to the supervised learning approch methods 
- 4 : at this point, generating list of features is a hot launch, we need to focus on the treatments side and also mak it a hot launches 
- 5 : what we know about each of the two wings of the projects has to be crossed...to be thought about.

Present developpements : 
- the wiki has the entries for the scientific reasoning until here

Ongoing : 
- making a code for the univariate as a standalone quick launch command line tool on Python 3.7

###### Progress on Q2

None
