###### Welcome to the ATIP3_intro wiki!

A start on ATIP 3 and around it a bit...

Scientific questions : 

- Q1 : What are the molecular workings of the ATIP3 protein in the setting of those severe cases of breast cancer ?
- Q2 : What compounds could be candidate for a treatment ?



###### Progress on Q1

The idea : lets start small and build a code that can give us genes that are candidates for a role in the variation of a response

Steps for Q1 : 
- 0 : make a code for each class of methods (univariate, multivariate and learning based) as ready to run code ()
- 1 : just choose a dataset for gex and compare away! 
- 2 : a synthetic benchmark is needed. NB : the email of the synthetic dataset from Chlo√© use it for the synthetic benchmark after the code is ready 
- 3 : we need to push further on the networks and compare them to the supervised learning approch methods 
- 4 : at this point, generating list of features is a hot launch, we need to focus on the treatments side and also mak it a hot launch 
- 5 : what we know about each of the two wings of the projects has to be crossed...to be thought about.

###### Present developpements : 
- the wiki has the entries for the scientific reasoning until here
- 3 cohorts datasets (REMAGUS02, REMAGUS02 or MDAnderson) are available with gene expression data ()
- A Python 3.7 code has been started
- the code for univariate and multivariate analysis is ready. Tests will be done on each subsets of candidates selected by ML methods
- the code for ML methods is at 70%.

- 

###### Ongoing : 
- finishing the code for ML to select subsets of genes (multivariate and univariates methods to relaunch for subset of those subsets) 

###### Progress on Q2

None

#### Last caution
- the folder atip3_material/3_cohorts... has to be replaced by its newest edition in the drive
- get alias symbols for genes from here https://www.genenames.org/data/gene-symbol-report/#!/hgnc_id/HGNC:29789
(HUGO Gene Nomenclature Commitee)
#### Last progress 
- convert AFFIMETRIX probe set ID into gene symbol
- add the 2 multivariate tests used for feature selection in SLATE
- make a similar formater for R_04 ad MDA
